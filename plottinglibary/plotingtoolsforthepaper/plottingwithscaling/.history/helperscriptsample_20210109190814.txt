In line 5 you input the number of data sets
In line 6 to 8 you input the data sets. This size may vary!
Then you input the type of plot, c for classical, d for deviation & f for fitness
Then you input the name of the plot
Then you enter the way the file is saves
Line 13 is the x-Label
Line 14 is the y-Label
Line 15 is the starting index
Line 16 is the ending index of the functions
Line 17 is the the lower bound for the x axis plotted
Line 18 is the upper bound for the x axis plotted
Line 19 is the lower bound for the y axis 
Line 20 is the upper bound for the y axis plotted

the following lines are just the name of the data set & in the following line if they are constant or not
