usage:
../../../../bin/high_precision_pso c <config file name>
	Starts a PSO run specified by the configuration in the specified configuration file.
../../../../bin/high_precision_pso r <configuration backup file name with extension confBU>
	Restarts a stopped PSO run.
	The file with extension ".SHUTDOWN" needs to be available.
../../../../bin/high_precision_pso rf <configuration backup file name with extension confBU>
	Forces the restart of a stopped PSO run.
	The file with extension ".SHUTDOWN" is not necessary.
../../../../bin/high_precision_pso restart <config file name> <backup file name>
	Restarts a PSO with the specified configuration file and backup file.
	It starts running at the time step stored in the backup file.
	The configuration file can be modified as long as the changes do not influence the movement of the swarm.
	For example the number of iterations can be increased or statistics (and when they should be displayed) can be modified completely.
../../../../bin/high_precision_pso restartAll <folder>
	Restarts all PSO runs in the specified folder if file with extension ".SHUTDOWN" is available.
	This command can be used in a cron job to restart PSO runs automatically if a time interval starts where running PSO is not forbidden.
../../../../bin/high_precision_pso -version
	Prints the version of the PSO program.
../../../../bin/high_precision_pso -gmpversion
	Prints the used version of the gmp library.
