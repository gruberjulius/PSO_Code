* @brief This class implements the bound handling strategy hyperbolic for the particle swarm optimization.

* For each dimension the new velocity vel[i] is scaled by 1/(|vel[i]/av| +1),
* where av is the distance to the search space bound in direction of the velocity.
* As this bound handling strategy already adjusts the velocity no further velocity adjustment is applied.
* The new position is calculated by adding the adjusted new velocity to the old position.
