Folder for a Project I created together with 3 colleagues for the Design of Parallel and High-Performance Computing class at ETH Zurich. 

Our final report is also contained in the repository and can be found in the Report.pdf.

We would definitly reshape and restructure lots of parts of the code, still it is definitly a project worth showing.
